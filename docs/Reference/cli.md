# CLI reference

The `fwl-io` command has five subcommands. Failures are reported as concise messages on stderr (never a traceback) and exit with status 1; success exits 0. `sync` and `fetch` aggregate per-dataset failures into a multi-line report, and a download failure lists every mirror attempt.

## fwl-io sync

```bash
fwl-io sync path/to/manifest.toml
```

Queries the Zenodo record of every dataset in the manifest and rewrites the registry file next to the manifest. Rejects concept DOIs. All datasets are attempted; per-dataset failures are collected and reported together at the end, and successfully synced registries are still written.

## fwl-io list

```bash
fwl-io list
```

Lists every dataset from all installed manifests with its key and consumers. Datasets without a committed registry are flagged `[NO REGISTRY]`. Providers whose manifest fails to load are reported on stderr and the exit status is 1.

## fwl-io fetch

```bash
fwl-io fetch <model> [--data-root PATH]
```

Fetches every dataset that lists `<model>` in its `required_by`. All datasets are attempted; failures are aggregated into one report. `--data-root` overrides the `FWL_DATA` tree.

## fwl-io check

```bash
fwl-io check <model> [--data-root PATH]
```

Reports whether every dataset that lists `<model>` in its `required_by` is present and matches its registry, without downloading anything. Each file is reported in one of four states: `ok` (present, checksum matches), `missing`, `mismatch` (present, contents differ), or `present`. The last means the file is there and nothing was available to verify it against, which is the case for the members of an archive dataset: the registry pins the checksum of the archive, not of the files extracted from it, so such a dataset is reported `presence only`.

A manifest that fails to load is reported alongside the datasets and is on its own enough to fail the check, because its datasets were never inspected. The report goes to stdout whatever the verdict, so a caller running this to find out what is wrong gets the detail and not only the exit status. Exit is 1 on any missing file, any checksum mismatch, any unreadable manifest, or a model no manifest declares.

Nothing is downloaded and no dataset directory or file is written, which makes this safe to run against a tree another process is reading. The equivalent Python entry point is `fwl_io.check_for`.

## fwl-io mirror

```bash
DATAVERSE_TOKEN=... fwl-io mirror <zenodo-doi> --collection <alias> \
    [--dataverse-url URL] [--contact-email EMAIL] [--subject SUBJECT] \
    [--no-publish] [--dry-run]
```

Mirrors a pinned Zenodo deposit to a Dataverse collection: it downloads and checksum-verifies the deposit's files, creates a matching Dataverse dataset with citation metadata taken from the Zenodo record, uploads the files byte-identically (tabular ingest disabled), and by default publishes the dataset, then prints the Dataverse DOI to add to the consuming manifest. The API token is read from the `DATAVERSE_TOKEN` environment variable, never a command-line argument. A contact email (`--contact-email`) is required to create a dataset; only `--dry-run`, which makes no Dataverse writes, is exempt. `--subject` is validated by the server when the dataset is created, so a value outside the target installation's citation vocabulary is rejected then. `--dry-run` performs the download and metadata mapping only, making no Dataverse changes; `--no-publish` leaves the created dataset as a private draft. See [Mirror a deposit to Dataverse](../How-to/mirror_dataset.md).

## fwl-io --version

Prints the installed version.
