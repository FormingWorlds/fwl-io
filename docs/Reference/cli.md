# CLI reference

The `fwl-io` command has four subcommands. Failures are reported as concise messages on stderr (never a traceback) and exit with status 1; success exits 0. `sync` and `fetch` aggregate per-dataset failures into a multi-line report, and a download failure lists every mirror attempt.

## fwl-io sync

```bash
fwl-io sync path/to/manifest.toml
```

Queries the Zenodo record of every dataset in the manifest and rewrites the registry file next to the manifest. Rejects concept DOIs. All datasets are attempted; per-dataset failures are collected and reported together at the end, and successfully synced registries are still written.

## fwl-io list

```bash
fwl-io list
```

Lists every dataset from all installed manifests with its location and consumers. Datasets without a committed registry are flagged `[NO REGISTRY]`. Providers whose manifest fails to load are reported on stderr and the exit status is 1.

## fwl-io fetch

```bash
fwl-io fetch <model> [--data-root PATH]
```

Fetches every dataset that lists `<model>` in its `required_by`. All datasets are attempted; failures are aggregated into one report. `--data-root` overrides the `FWL_DATA` tree.

## fwl-io mirror

```bash
DATAVERSE_TOKEN=... fwl-io mirror <zenodo-doi> --collection <alias> \
    [--dataverse-url URL] [--contact-email EMAIL] [--subject SUBJECT] \
    [--no-publish] [--dry-run]
```

Mirrors a pinned Zenodo deposit to a Dataverse collection: it downloads and checksum-verifies the deposit's files, creates a matching Dataverse dataset with citation metadata taken from the Zenodo record, uploads the files byte-identically (tabular ingest disabled), and by default publishes the dataset, then prints the Dataverse DOI to add to the consuming manifest. The API token is read from the `DATAVERSE_TOKEN` environment variable, never a command-line argument. A contact email (`--contact-email`) is required to create a dataset, and `--subject` must be one of Dataverse's citation subjects; only `--dry-run` is exempt from both. `--dry-run` performs the download and metadata mapping only, making no Dataverse changes; `--no-publish` leaves the created dataset as a private draft. See [Mirror a deposit to Dataverse](../How-to/mirror_dataset.md).

## fwl-io --version

Prints the installed version.
